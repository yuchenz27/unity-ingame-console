# Unity In-Game Console

When we build Unity games for devices, we cannot see the console logs. I made this package to avoid repeatedly making in-game consoles. You can install this Unity package and drag the `In-Game Console` prefab into your scene to use it.

The following gif demonstrates the in-game console on an Apple Vision Pro device, utilizing the `LazyFollow` script from Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit (XRI) package.
